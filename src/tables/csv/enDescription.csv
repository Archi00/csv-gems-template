85;<div>Turquoise</div><div><br></div><div>Turquoise is one of the gems, to which many cultures, since the beginning of time, have given great importance.</div><div><br></div><div>Turquoise is one of the most used stones in different cultures for ornamental, magical and power purposes. It is a stone used since prehistory in almost the whole world, highlighting the cultures of Egypt, Tibet and China, of the American Indians, of the Middle East.</div><div><br></div><div>Quality turquoise is one of the most difficult gems to obtain with guarantees of authenticity. Because turquoise became fashionable in the 60's and 70's many of the American deposits were depleted and a veritable industry dedicated to the stabilization and reconstitution of turquoise (in the best of cases) was launched.</div><div><br></div><div>Turquoise that is not of sufficient quality is dyed and hardened with plastic impregnation. In today's market it is very difficult to distinguish natural turquoise from the one in question by various methods; on the other hand a multitude of similes and imitations try to deceive the user.</div><div><br></div><div>Currently the most important deposits in exploitation are in the USA, and China, it is also extracted in Mexico, Iran, in addition to other small deposits widely distributed throughout the world (Peru, Nepal, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, etc.)</div>

522;<div>Turquoise</div><div><br></div><div>Turquoise is one of the gems, to which many cultures, since the beginning of time, have given great importance.</div><div><br></div><div>Turquoise is one of the most used stones in different cultures for ornamental, magical and power purposes. It is a stone used since prehistory in almost the whole world, highlighting the cultures of Egypt, Tibet and China, of the American Indians, of the Middle East.</div><div><br></div><div>Quality turquoise is one of the most difficult gems to obtain with guarantees of authenticity. Because turquoise became fashionable in the 60's and 70's many of the American deposits were depleted and a veritable industry dedicated to the stabilization and reconstitution of turquoise (in the best of cases) was launched.</div><div><br></div><div>Turquoise that is not of sufficient quality is dyed and hardened with plastic impregnation. In today's market it is very difficult to distinguish natural turquoise from the one in question by various methods; on the other hand a multitude of similes and imitations try to deceive the user.</div><div><br></div><div>Currently the most important deposits in exploitation are in the USA, and China, it is also extracted in Mexico, Iran, in addition to other small deposits widely distributed throughout the world (Peru, Nepal, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, etc.)</div>
523;<div>Ruby</div><div><br></div><div>It derives its name from the Latin ruber - red.</div><div><br></div><div>In Sanskrit it was called Ratnaraj - 'The King of Gems'.</div><div><br></div><div>He belongs to the corundum family. Red corundums are called rubies and all other colors are called sapphires.</div><div><br></div><div>Al2O3C</div>
525;<div>Sphene</div><div>Sphene, also known as titanite, is a high-gloss yellowish-green, green, or brown gemstone with unique shades of color and a brilliant cut, intense fiery appearance that can rival diamond. Sphene has always been a rare gem on the market. New deposits have increased and there is now more sphene on the market.</div><div><br></div><div>Sphene comes from the Greek word for "wedge," due to its typical wedge-shaped crystal habit. The mineralogical name 'Titanite' derives from its titanium content. The sphene is strongly pleochroic, displaying at least three colors (colorless, greenish-yellow, and reddish) when viewed from different angles.</div><div><br></div><div>The brilliant cut serves to enhance the 'fire' better. Depending on the clarity, sphene is also carved in cabochon and round cut shapes. With a hardness of 5 -5.5 on the Mohs scale, sphene is a soft gem that needs care and is best used alone for pendants, earrings or brooches.</div>
